# Work Day Planner (Scheduler)

## Description

My motivation was to add additional JavaScript & jQuery code to the starter code. The starter code was created to allow a user to save events for each work hour of the day. The typical work hour in the US is 8 hours, but it is not always true. The issue with the starter code was that it was missing code for the planner to work properly. The additional refactoring of the starter code was needed so the planner may work properly. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

An internet browser such Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Google will need to be installed for the Work Day Schedule

## Usage

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
